i had a [repo](https://github.com/sinadarvi/kotlin-for-android-developers) that tranlated from japanease repo and as i explained in future plans in that repo i wanted to translate it to persian but after a while my repo was blocked by DCMA rules so i talk to Antonio Leiva, writer of this book, and he let me translate it and publish it on another repo, so i made this repo.

I hope you buy genuine, it is recommended to read the original Englishï¼šhttps://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book/
